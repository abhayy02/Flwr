Federated Learning with Flower Framework

This repository contains an implementation of federated learning for healthcare applications using the Flower framework. The project aims to explore privacy-preserving collaborative training of machine learning models on decentralized medical datasets, such as COVID-19 and pneumonia data.

Key Features:

1. **Federated Learning Strategies**: Implements and compares various federated learning strategies, including FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdam, and FedAdagrad, to facilitate collaborative model training while ensuring data privacy.

2. **Flower Framework Integration**: Leverages the Flower framework, a versatile and customizable tool for implementing federated learning systems, enabling decentralized training across multiple healthcare institutions or data sources.

3. **COVID-19 and Pneumonia Datasets**: Includes preprocessing and loading scripts for two popular medical datasets: COVID-19 and pneumonia, allowing for evaluation and benchmarking of federated learning models on real-world healthcare data.

4. **Centralized vs. Federated Training**: Provides a comprehensive comparison between centralized training and federated training approaches, evaluating model performance in terms of accuracy and loss metrics.

5. **Visualizations and Analysis**: Includes scripts for generating informative visualizations and performing in-depth analysis of the federated learning process, model convergence, and performance across different strategies.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and healthcare professionals interested in exploring privacy-preserving collaborative learning for medical diagnosis and decision support systems. Contributions, issues, and feedback are welcome.
